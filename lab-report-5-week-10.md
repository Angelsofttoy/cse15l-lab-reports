# _**Tests Comparision**_

1. **How you found the tests with different results (Did you use vimdiff on the results of running a bash for loop? Did you search through manually? Did you use some other programmatic idea?)**

A: I found the tests with different results by using vimdiff command, which shows the test results of each test side by side in the terminal. I used this specific command below:
```
$ vimdiff my-markdown-parser/results.txt cse15lsp22-markdown-parser/results.txt
```
Then I just scrolled down to find any reuslt discrepencies and took screenshots.

For this one, the implementation of the TA's MarkdownParse.java is the correct implemetntaion. Because as I put it in VS code to see if the text portion within the middle brakcet is highlighted, it is indeed highlighted as shown by the picture below:

**In summary:**

* Expected Output:
```
[/url]
```
* Actual Output(of my implementaion):
```
[]
```
* Actual Output(of TAs' implementation):
```
[/url]
```

So in this case my implementation was wrong, as the codes identified the text as an invalid URL markdown format, while the passed in text indeed contains valid URL format. 

**Analysis for incorrect implementation:** 

A: For this test, my implementaion had the incorrect list of URL as the result, which is an empty middle bracket when it should contain the aforementioned URL link. I think this is due to this segment of my code:
![Image](./lab5/5-1-4.jpg)

```
urlDot = markdown.indexOf(".", openBracket);

openParen = markdown.indexOf("(", closeBracket);
if(openParen == -1 || openParen!= closeBracket + 1){
    System.out.println("Error: Invalid link format openParen!");
    break;
}

closeParen = markdown.indexOf(")", openParen); 

if(!(openParen < urlDot) && !(urlDot < closeParen) || urlDot == -1){
    System.out.println("Error: Invalid link format urlDot!");
    break;
}
```
This segment of code was initially implemented for testing whether the web url within the parenthesis is a valid url with dots(since that seemed to be the usual case). Nevertheless, I wasn't able to consider the fact that no matter the text contained within the parenthesis is a valid dotted url or not, as long as the markdown format is correct, even if there is only a number within the parenthesis, the url will still be valid on a page with rendered markdown. Thus, if the condition listed above is deleted, then my Markdown.java would have been able to produce similar result as the TA implementation.

For this test case, the implementation of my MarkdownParse.java was the correct one, for it considered the case that if the symbol at the next index of closing middle bracket, is not a paraenthesis, then this would make the markdown url to be an invalid one. 

![Image](./lab5/5-6-4.jpg)

**In summary:**

* Expected Output:
```
[]
```
* Actual Output(of my implementaion):
```
[]
```
* Actual Output(of TAs' implementation):
```
[/uri]
```

Indeed, in this test case, there's a blank space between the closing middle bracket and the opening paranthesis which were detected by the following implementation within my codes:

![Image](./lab5/5-6-1.jpg)
```
if(openParen == -1 || openParen!= closeBracket + 1){
    System.out.println("Error: Invalid link format openParen!");
    break;
}
```
**Analysis for incorrect implementation:** 

Instead, this invalid url markdown wasn't able to be detected in lab9's MarkdownParse.java was because it merely considered how to read in multiple links that have matching paraenthesis into the list, and also because of a slightly unsuitable if condition as we could see belowï¼š

![Image](./lab5/5-6-2.jpg)

The reason why this is incorrect because potentialLink is always considering the blank space after the opening parenthesis and the slash sign(which is used for canceling the oepning parenthesis). But the fact is it failed to consider situations where the blank space is before the opening parenthesis which could also lead to an invalid URL. Thus this lab9 implementation wasn't able to distinguish the passed-in text as an invalid URL markdown format.
