# _**A Tutorial for Logging into a Remote Computer(ieng6)!**_

Hii!! Future CSE15L students! (including future myself who may forget some of the course content) 

This blog post is made for *you* ! To get to know how to:

    1. Remotely log into a lab computer at school.
    2. Access its repositories and file datas within it.
    3. Modify file datas on remote repositories.

You might be worried that it's a bit complicated, but no worries! This blog post is herr to guide you through it :) ! We will make it _**together**_ !

## 1. Installing Visual Studio Code

*Visual Studio Code* is a really great coding program that is capable of supporting various coding languages from Java to C++, etc. 

Most importantly, it has an easy-to-operate, easy-to-understand terminal, which will be our main resort in logging into a remote computer. 

_**But first, we need to install it!**_

Let's go to Visual Studio Code's Official Link for [downloading the software](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and finish the installing process. 

Depnding on your computer's operating system(Linux/Window/Mac), you should download corresponding Visual Studio Code version onto your computer. 

After you are finished with downloading it and setting up, its homepage should look something like this:

Congrats! You have finished the first step! *_*coffetti*_* ! Where are my *_*coffettis*_*! 

## 2. Connect to Your own Remote Computer

Before we put any cool commands in Visual Studio code's terminal, you need to first know your CSE15L account, click on [UCSD's educaitional technology service website](https://sdacs.ucsd.edu/~icc/index.php), so you could do some account look up:).

Once you know what is your account name specifically, we could now begin the remotely connecting process! Yay!!

**_Firstly_**, let's open the terminal on your visual studio code by click on Terminal --> New Terminal on the menu tab. 

Then, afterh the $ sign in terminal, you need to input your CSE15L account name, which should be the below format(the bolded part should be your account specfic name):

* $ cs15lsp22 **_zz_** @ieng6.ucsd.edu

After pressing return, as it's your first time of logging into this remote computer, you will probably get a warning message, that asks you something like, *whether you are sure of connecting to this computer? (yes/no/[fingerprint])*

After seeing this appeared in the terminal, do not panic! Just type yes and press return. Then you should be able to see it's prompting you to enter the password too. 

Enter your account password, **also**, do not **_panic_** if you can't see the password you entered in the terminal. Your input is being recorded, it's just won't show visually. Press return after you finished entering the password. 

Then you should able to see this ! :

Congrats! This means you have successfully logged onto a remote computer at the lab! Isn't this exciting *:D* ?
