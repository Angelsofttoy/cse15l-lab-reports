# _**A Tutorial for Logging into a Remote Computer(ieng6)!**_

Hii!! Future CSE15L students! (including future myself who may forget some of the course content) 

This blog post is made for *you* ! To get to know how to:

    1. Remotely log into a lab computer at school.
    2. Access its repositories and file datas within it.
    3. Modify file datas on remote repositories.

You might be worried that it's a bit complicated, but no worries! This blog post is herr to guide you through it :) ! We will make it _**together**_ !

## 1. Installing Visual Studio Code

*Visual Studio Code* is a really great coding program that is capable of supporting various coding languages from Java to C++, etc. 

Most importantly, it has an easy-to-operate, easy-to-understand terminal, which will be our main resort in logging into a remote computer. 

_**But first, we need to install it!**_

Let's go to Visual Studio Code's Official Link for [downloading the software](https://code.visualstudio.com/), and finish the installing process. 

Depnding on your computer's operating system(Linux/Window/Mac), you should download corresponding Visual Studio Code version onto your computer. 

After you are finished with downloading it and setting up, its homepage should look something like this:
