# _**Faster Runner**_
## **3. Copy whole directories with scp -r**
For copying the whole markdown directory to one's ieng6 account, we simply need to put this command in the terminal:

```
$ scp -r . ieng6:markdown-parser 
```
And as we could see below the file listed within this directory are all being copied into my ieng6 account. 

![image](./lab3/3-1.jpg)
![image](./lab3/3-2.jpg)

It's pretty easy to run this in our ieng6 account after we have copied this markdown-paraser repository: 

![image](./lab3/3-3.jpg)

As we could see, all of the test are sucessfully being ran on ieng6 server.
